Widgets for terminal/console/TUI/CUI/CLI

Goals:

* Be extremely efficient/convenient for user
* Be versatile such as blessed and blessed-contrib for Node.js
* Be better than existing Ruby solutions, which are lagging behind

------

There are other projects marginally related to this one.
I am listing them here simply for comprehensiveness, not because they necessarily even serve the same purpose.

* In other languages: urwid, Curses::UI, STFL
* In Ruby (for curses or colors): ruby-curses
* In Ruby (for text tables): text_layout, text-table, pretty_table, terminal-table
* In Ruby (for CSS-like terminal layout engine): terminal-layout
* For layouts in Tmux: https://changelog.com/teamocil-ruby-yaml-tmux-layouts/
